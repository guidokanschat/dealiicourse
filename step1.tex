    \item Polygonal domain
    \item Curved boundary
    \end{itemize}
  \item Two ways of refining a mesh
    \begin{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item \lstinline!Triangulation<2>! is a two-dimensional mesh
  \item \lstinline!GridGenerator! functions create a mesh
  \item \lstinline!GridOut! writes a mesh as a graphics file

  \frametitle{Mesh facts}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \lstinline!Triangulation<dim>! always stores a hierarchy of
    mesh levels.
  \item A cell is identified by its level and an index inside the level
  \item The level of a cell is its distance by refinement from the
    original mesh
  \item Levels are modeled like STL containers
  \begin{block}{Loop over all cells of a level}

      \begin{itemize}
      \item Meshes can be refined to different levels in different regions
      \item Cells are still defined by level and index

    \begin{column}{.6\textwidth}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Cells belong to different levels
        \item Cells visible in this graph are called active
          \begin{itemize}
          \item They are the leaves of the refinement tree
          \item They are the actual mesh for computation
          \end{itemize}
      \item We need a new iterator
