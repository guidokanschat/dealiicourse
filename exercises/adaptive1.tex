  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Do not begin with Step 6! We start with Step 4!
  \item Create a mesh with three global refinements and one additional
    refinement of all cells in the negative quadrant/octant.
  \item Commpute the solution on this mesh and see that it is severely
    distorted at the interface between cells of different level.
