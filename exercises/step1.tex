  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Locally refined square mesh
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Create a mesh for the square $[-1,1]^2$ and refine once globally.
    \item On a given mesh refine all cells with at least one vertex in
      the cicle of radius $1/8$ around the origin. Repeat 6 times to
      resolve the circle.
    \item Visualize the result (gnuplot, SVG, or VTK).
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Refinement smoothing: same as before, but refine in such a way
    that no cells sharing a common vertex differ by more than one
    level. Hint: constructor of \lstinline!Triangulation!
  \item Guess from the different results what the effect of
    \lstinline!set_all_manifold_ids! is
  \item Generate a half open shell. How do inner and outer radius
    affect the shape of cells? Find a way to visualize.
  \end{enumerate}
